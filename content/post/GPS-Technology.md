You can find GPS systems in your car, your smartphone and your watch. GPS helps you get where you are going, from point A to point B.

##What is GPS and how does it work?

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a navigation system using satellites, a receiver and algorithms to synchronize location, velocity and time data for air, sea and land travel.

While we only need three satellites to produce a location on earth’s surface, a fourth satellite is often used to validate the information from the other three. The fourth satellite also moves us into the third-dimension and allows us to calculate the altitude of a device.

##What are the three elements of GPS?

Space (Satellites) — The satellites circling the Earth, transmitting signals to users on geographical position and time of day.

Ground control — The Control Segment is made up of Earth-based monitor stations, master control stations and ground antenna. Control activities include tracking and operating the satellites in space and monitoring transmissions. There are monitoring stations on almost every continent in the world, including North and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia.

User equipment — GPS receivers and transmitters including items like watches, smartphones and telematic devices.
