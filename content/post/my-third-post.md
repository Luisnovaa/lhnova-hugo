Bionic Engineering is known as the one specialized in the production of technological tools that simulate the
functioning or model of living beings. Its objective is the combination of electronic and biological systems,
enhancing its advantages and characteristics. examples of this are:
BIONIC HAND PROSTHESIS
It is usually made of polyurethane that guarantees stability and lightweight. It is important that to achieve almost natural replacement of the lost hand, the user should receive the noticeable sensations that he perceives when grasping or
manipulate an object. It connects to the host's nervous system at two of the main nerves in the arm, the median
and the ulnar nerves, through transverse multichannel intrafascicular electrodes.
.
In the article "Restoring Natural Sensory Feedback in Real-Time Bidirectional Hand Prostheses"

, it is detailed that the
The participant was able to effectively modulate the grip strength of the prosthesis without visual or auditory feedback. The
subject distinguished three different levels of force. The results also show that a high
complexity of perception, allowing the subject to identify the rigidity and shape of three different objects. East
approach could improve the efficacy and quality of hand prostheses, resulting in a key strategy
for almost natural replacement of lost hands.

The project NEBIAS6 (NEUROCONTROLLED BIDIRECTIONAL ARTIFICIAL UPPER LIMB AND HAND PROSTHESIS), is the
continuation of intensive multidisciplinary research in this field that began years ago with the
CYBERHAND project, belonging to the activity “Future and emerging technologies (FET) of the Fifth Program
Marco (FP5, 2002-2005) ”. He managed to create a prototype of a mechanical hand and, in the "Sixth and Seventh Framework Programs
(6 PM and 7 PM) ”, research on the connection of robotic agents and the nervous system was intensified, until

successfully tested a prototype electrode lacking sensory information. This bionic hand is shown in Fig.
currently considered the most advanced model of the existing ones.
