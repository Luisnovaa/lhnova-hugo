"The cancer experience is a test of endurance and unfortunately the focus is on the people who succumb to the disease but not on the overwhelming numbers that survive. One of the things I found was important to me was to mark the ending of my treatment in a way that was significant, to celebrate the end of my treatment. It was like crossing a finish line."
~ Mary Coulter ~

The Legacy
The Cancer Survivors Garden at McKillop Park opened officially on June 3, 2012 - National Cancer Survivors Day and is located at the corner of Wonderland Road and Riverside Dr. in London, Ontario.

Though this project is finished and open for public use there are other organizations in London and the surrounding area that need your support to provide services for individuals and families undergoing treatment and you will find links of some organizations that support the idea of the garden as a place of hope and encouragement.
