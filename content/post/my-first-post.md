This device was developed by the North American company Intuitive Surgical and approved in 2000 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States.
It is used for multiple surgical procedures, including prostatectomies and vaginal hysterectomy. The da Vinci robot is not autonomous; in all cases requires the intervention and decision-making of a professional who acts as a human operator for all actions.
components:

-Ergonomic console from which the surgeon operates seated and which normally, is in the same operating room.

-Vision tower (formed by controllers, video, audio and image processing).

-The surgical trolley that incorporates three or four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console, at the end of which are attached to the different tools that the doctor needs to operate, such as scalpels, scissors, unipolar, etc.
